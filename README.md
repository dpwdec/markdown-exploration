Above is some HTML that was inserted into this .md file.

This is ean example of a <font color='red'>span level</font> HTML tag used in Markdown. However, it doesn't work on Github because Github does not support span level inline HTML for markdown.  

This paragraph features a break tag above it.

## This is an example of an H2 heading

#### This is an example of an H4 heading with a closing Hash #

Below is a quote:

> What are these primary dispositions on which Freud himself apparently founders? Are these attributes of an unconscious libidinal organization, and how precisely do the various identifications set up in consequence of the Oedipal conflict work to reinforce or dissolve each of these dispositions? What aspect of “femininity” do we call dispositional, and which is the consequence of identification? Indeed, what is to keep us from understanding the “dispositions” of bisexuality as the effects or productions of a series of internalizations? Moreover, how do we identify a “feminine” or a “masculine” disposition at the outset? By what traces is it known, and to what extent do we assume a “feminine” or a “masculine” disposition as the precondition of a heterosexual object choice? In other words, to what extent do we read the desire for the father as evidence of a feminine disposition only because we begin, despite the postulation of primary bisexuality, with a heterosexual matrix for desire?
