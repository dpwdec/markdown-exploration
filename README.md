This is a test project to explore the Markdown format and Github flavored Markdown.

Above is some HTML that was inserted into this .md file.

This is ean example of a <font color='red'>span level</font> HTML tag used in Markdown. However, it doesn't work on Github because Github does not support span level inline HTML for markdown.  

This paragraph features a break tag above it.

## This is an example of an H2 heading

#### This is an example of an H4 heading with a closing Hash #

Below is a quote:

> What are these primary dispositions on which Freud himself apparently founders? Are these attributes of an unconscious libidinal organization, and how precisely do the various identifications set up in consequence of the Oedipal conflict work to reinforce or dissolve each of these dispositions? What aspect of “femininity” do we call dispositional, and which is the consequence of identification? Indeed, what is to keep us from understanding the “dispositions” of bisexuality as the effects or productions of a series of internalizations? Moreover, how do we identify a “feminine” or a “masculine” disposition at the outset? By what traces is it known, and to what extent do we assume a “feminine” or a “masculine” disposition as the precondition of a heterosexual object choice? In other words, to what extent do we read the desire for the father as evidence of a feminine disposition only because we begin, despite the postulation of primary bisexuality, with a heterosexual matrix for desire?

And a verbose type nested quote:

> In “Mourning and Melancholia,” the lost object is set up within the ego as a critical voice
> or agency, and the anger originally felt for the object is reversed so that
> the internalized object now berates the ego:
>
> > If one listens patiently to the many and various self-accusations of the

> > the most violent of them are hardly applicable to the patient himself,
> > but that with insignificant modifications they do fit someone else,
> > some person whom the patient loves, has loved or ought to love....
> > the self-reproaches are reproaches against a loved object which have

>
> The melancholic refuses the loss of the object, and internalization
> becomes a strategy of magically resuscitating the lost object, not only
> Gender Trouble because the loss is painful, but because the ambivalence felt toward the
> object requires that the object be retained until differences are settled.
> In this early essay, Freud understands grief to be the withdrawal of
> libidinal cathexis from the object and the successful transferral of that
> cathexis onto a fresh object.

And a simple type nested quote:

> The construction of the interior ego ideal involves the internaliProhibition, Psychoanalysis, and the Heterosexual Matrixzation of gender identities as well. Freud remarks that the ego ideal is
a solution to the Oedipal complex and is thus instrumental in the
successful consolidation of masculinity and femininity:
>
> > The super-ego is, however, not simply a residue of the earliest
object-choices of the id: it also represents an energetic reaction-formation against these choices. Its relation to the ego is not exhausted
by the precept: “You ought to be like this (like your father.)” It also
comprises the prohibition: “You may not be like this (like your
father)—that is, you may not do all that he does; some things are his
prerogative.” (24)
>
> The ego ideal thus serves as an interior agency of sanction and
taboo which, according to Freud, works to consolidate gender identity
through the appropriate rechanneling and sublimation of desire.
